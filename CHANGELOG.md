# UI 0.8.2

- üéà Fix: Piece Source dragged now are rendered with the correct zooming
- üéà Fix: Modal prompt for naming spaces now auto-focus on input and is dismissed with ESC
- üßπ Clean: Remove icon selection from space configurator since the Mini View is now used on the home screen
- üßπ Clean: A lot of internal code clean up
- üéõ Tweak: The activity log is not filled now on Library items, and when exporing a space the activity log is purged
- üéõ Tweak: On Play or View mode all elements are fit on the screen (with some padding) and then panning and zooming is locked
- üéõ Tweak: When there aren't any active games on the home screen, show a message instead
- üéõ Tweak: Config Menu
  - Now instead of showing disabled elements it hides them
  - The locking system has a different non-editable view for Play mode
  - If there aren't any Config Menu items available on Play Mode, it won't show up
- üéâ New: The Selection System
  - Big overhaul on how dragging and events are handled on the Surface component
  - You can now select elements as you would expect (drag a square, or click, shift+click to toggle, shift+drag to add to selection)
  - Dragging selected elements will move all elements selected
  - Moving a single element does not select it
- üß® Overhaul: The Resizing System
  - Resizing was redone; now you can resize from any edge or corner
  - You can Shift+Resize to keep aspect ratio
  - You can Alt+Resize to resize symetrically
  - The resizing overlay shows for selected elements only
- üéâ New: Clear Space Modes
  - A space is in either edit mode, view mode or play mode
  - Library items are on edit mode
  - Active games are on view mode if you haven't joined the game, and play mode if you have
  - Archived spaces are on view mode
  - On active games you can switch temporarily to Edit Mode
  - On Edit Mode you can modify the elements locks and actions ignore the locking mechanisms
  - On Play Mode the actions available to elements are determined by the elements Can Configuration, which can only be modified from Edit Mode.
  - Lock System -> Can Configuration
    - The Can Configuration is part of elements and controls:
      - Moving
      - Resizing
      - Rotating
      - Adding/removing attachments
      - Modifying the element configuration
      - Removing and duplicating
    - The Can Configuration applies to Play Mode only; on edit mode you can modify it, but you are not bound by it
    - The Can Configuration can be accessed from the context menu of elements
- ‚ùå Disabled: The rotation system is temporarily non-functional until next release

# UI 0.8.1
 - Improved initial clients loading
 - Implemented more direct asset selection for "search", "creatables" and "pocket"
 - Overhauling of the lock system; now named instead on the positive: "can system". The locks apply only on game mode, and on edit mode everything is allowed and locks can be changed. The ConfigMenu only shows the things that are allowed if any. By default you can attach assets and move on newly created elements. On piece source elements you can additionally delete them.
